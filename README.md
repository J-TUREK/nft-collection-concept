# nft-collection-concept
Computer generated "artwork" to conceptualize the creation of an NFT collection, for fun

Planned roadmap:

1. Create N unique digital pieces of abstract "artwork" using basic cryptography concepts.
2. Split the pieces of artwork into X pieces.
3. Generate the collection using unique conbinations of the pieces.
4. Integrate the collection with an NFT network
